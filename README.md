# CountryApplication

In this Application. I used GridView (an android widget for displaying list items), and an adapter to set the items of the GridView.
All the list items are country Images and The country's name.
This app also has configuration implemented as well so when the user wants to switch the app language to Arabic the MainActivity is refreshed with a new language and viceversa.

In order to allow this kind of functionality you have to add a new resource file of the "Values" and have all your app strings (Texts) manually translated into the other languages that you want your app to work with.

After changing configuration and Locale of the current Activity Android automatically fetches the strings from the changed to language.


NOTE: Not all the text languages will change, some widgets won't change ie button texts, and Dialog texts.

I will continue to update this application and add some more fun features to improve the User Interface.
