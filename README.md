# CountryApplication

In this Application. I used GridView (an android widget for displaying list items), and an adapter to set the items of the GridView.
All the list items are country Images and The country's name.
This app also has configuration implemented as well so when the user wants to switch the app language to Arabic the MainActivity is refreshed with a new language and viceversa.


I will continue to update this application and add some more fun features to improve the User Interface.
